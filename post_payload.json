  "caption": "“Train the spirit as you train the sword.”\n\nReflection:\nThe warrior of faith sharpens the heart daily — discipline, prayer, endurance.

Mastery of the self precedes mastery of the fight.\n\n#VeniPublishing #VeniFaithful #Ephesians611 #Zechariah46 #ChristianMen #FaithOverFear #SpiritualWarfare #armorofgodverse #ChristianQuotes #ChristianArt",
