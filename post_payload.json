Humility opens the door for holiness to dwell.\n\nCommentary:\nJohn’s words teach the essence of surrender — to let ego give way so that grace can grow. Greatness is found in letting God take center stage.\n\n#VeniPublishing #VeniFaithful #ChristianMeditation #MonasticLife #OrthodoxChristian #CatholicInspiration #SilenceAndSolitude #JesusChrist #FaithQuotes",
