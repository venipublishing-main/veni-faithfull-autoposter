The spirit gathers power where words end and stillness begins. There, faith roots itself deeply in peace.\n\nCommentary:\nSt. Teresa reminds us that silence is not weakness but renewal. In quiet moments, courage and clarity take root, preparing us for life’s noise.\n\n#VeniFaithful #VeniPublishing #DesertFathers #ContemplativePrayer #SilenceAndSolitude #OrthodoxChristian #AsceticSpirituality #DailyDevotional #FaithQuotes",
