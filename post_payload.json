  "caption": "“Courage is born where fear is crucified.”\n\nReflection:\nWhen fear dies upon the cross of trust, courage rises in its place.

Faith turns dread into devotion, and trembling into triumph.\n\n#VeniFaithful #VeniPublishing #ChristianMen #FaithOverFear #BattleBelongsToTheLord #Zechariah46 #ScriptureDaily #spiritualwarfareprayerspdf #howtofightspiritualwarfare #whatisspiritualwarfare #ChristianInspiration #PrayerWarrior",
