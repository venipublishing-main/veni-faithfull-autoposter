The disciplined soul keeps faith when fervor fades, serving love with steady hands.\n\nCommentary:\nDiscipline here means faithfulness in practice — prayer, work, and patience. Devotion is proven not by feeling inspired but by showing up daily.\n\n#VeniFaithful #VeniPublishing #OrthodoxChristian #FaithDiscipline #LectioDivina #MonasticLife #CatholicInspiration #DailyDevotional #PrayerWarrior",
