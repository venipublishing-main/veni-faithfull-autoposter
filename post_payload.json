  "caption": "“I saw eternity the other night.” — Henry Vaughan\n\nReflection:\nTime dissolved into light, and the soul glimpsed home. Eternity is nearer than our breath, shimmering beyond the veil.\n\nCommentary:\nVaughan’s vision invites us to see the eternal woven into the moment. Heaven is not distant — it pulses quietly within the now.\n\n#VeniPublishing #VeniFaithful #ContemplativeChristianity #HeavenOnEarth #WonderAndWorship #DivineLight #MysticalTheology #ScriptureOfTheDay #ChristianInspiration",
