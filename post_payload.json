  "caption": "“Be still, and know that I am God.” — Psalm 46:10\n\nReflection:\nIn the hush of dawn, the soul breathes again. Stillness strips away illusion until only truth remains. When the world falls silent, the Eternal is heard most clearly.\n\nCommentary:\nThis verse calls us to stop striving and rest in divine presence. Faith is not achieved through effort but through surrender — by allowing quiet to become prayer.\n\n#VeniPublishing #VeniFaithful #DesertFathers #RuleOfLife #LectioDivina #ContemplativePrayer #AsceticSpirituality #FaithQuotes #JesusChrist",
